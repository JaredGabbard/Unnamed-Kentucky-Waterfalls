# Unnamed Kentucky Waterfalls



### Data Source

[https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://...)

* Initial Data projection: The initial data projection had to be editted because when i ran the query for waterfalls in Kentucky, some assets were created that fell outside the Kentucky border for some reason.
* Final Map projection: The Final mao projection only includes waterfalls within the OpenStreetMap database that fell within the Kentucky Border. 

### Project Background
When trying to find a topic for the Final, I was messing around with QuickOSM data and when I made a query for waterfalls in Kentucky, I noticed not all waterfalls had names in the attribute table. I then decided to map those without names alongside the waterfalls with names. This map is usefull for those who wish to visit these waterfalls and perhaps come up with names for them themselves.

### Purpose

### Mapmaking Process


1. Added 2022 county and state data
2. Filtered county and state layers to only show Kentucky
3. Ran QuickOSM query for waterway, and specified waterfalls
4. manually selected and delted waterfalls that fell outside Kentucky's border
5. Categorized Symbology to dileniate colors based on whether the waterfall was named 
### Map summary

This map was created in order to show waterfalls in Kentucky that have not been officially named. This mao focusses only on Kentucky and includes points of Waterfalls that have been named, and those that are unnamed.
